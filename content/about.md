I'm a mathematical physics student at the University Of Waterloo passionate about physics, mathematics, computer science, and engineering. Particularly, the fields that fascinate me the most are quantum chromodynamics, linear algebra, effective algorithm and data structure design, and mechanical engineering. In spare time I enjoy weightlifting, zoology (particularly orthinology), history, and of course - video games. I have recently also developed an interest in financial analysis.
