#Background
So, I've been wanting to make my own personal website for a while now, both for professional and personal reasons. (Theoritically, this was/is supposed to double as centralised place to see my projects, resume, and personal writings on my blog).

Hence, I've decided to create a little bit of a mini-guide/summary on how I got my personal website up; and hopefully If I've explained everything correctly you too can have your own nice slice of the internet dedicated to yourself, by the time you finish this tutorial!
