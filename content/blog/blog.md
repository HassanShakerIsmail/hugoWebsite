So, after a long time of finally procrastinating and pushing it back, I finally decided to sit down and get my website up and running. I've got to admit, at first I wasn't really sure what to do with it. Initially, I had just planned this website to be something to impress prospective employeers (hello, if you're reading this!) but realized I wanted something more. In all the internet's vastness, this little digital slice of it is mine; and the thought of using it for the purpose of being glorified "business card" rubbed me the wrong way. The American psycho scene with Paul Allen's card comes to mind. 

In some way, I found this decision to reflective of not wanting to hide myself, my thoughts, and who I am as a person; just to appease someone all in the name of either chasing a meaningless title, salary - or worst of all, approval. (Though, don't worry - If I've applied to work at your company, it was because I thought the work was genuinely interesting and meaningful.)

That aside, I often find myself worried about the future. I find myself for better or for worse at one of the world's best universities but can't shake the feeling that if the world is in the hands of myself and my peers, then we're headed for disaster. What matters here, isn't who you are, what you believe in, or even your dreams, but your status. Six figures, "Cali-coops", resumes, good side projects, your linkedin profile - that's what matters now. How am I supposed to believe that we're to lead the world into a better place when what matters is how much your pay stub says at the end of the day? 

I wonder if it's always been this way. Maybe digitization has simply shed light on a problem that has always been with us as a species. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case. But still, I can't get that feeling off of me - that proverbial slime - that Me, my friends, colleagues, and everyone I'll know, will just be running the rat race chasing a fake piece of cheese that we're told will fufill us. 

But even with all the doom and gloom, I still do have hope. One thing life has taught me is that good people exist, and despite being the minority - still inspire me. Whether it's been my professors, friends, or just people life has thrown in my path along my journey on this planet, when I think of the time, blood, and sweat that these people have placed in me - I suddenly think that I have to hold hope and try as hard as I can to make the world a better place, if not for myself, at least as a thank you to those who placed faith in me.

But anyway,
so - there's my first post in my slice of the internet. Reading back on it, I wonder if perhaps this was too depressing, but I realize going back and censoring myself would defeat the purpose of what this was supposed to be. An honest journal reflective of what I really think, not masked like so many of us are these days.
