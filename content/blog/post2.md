I've always been a fan of animals since childhood. In grade school, I often would make posters about different animals and present them to the class; probably bothering my teachers but still worth the fun I had making them.

That being said, I've recently been learning about earth's history, and more specifically paleontology. Naturally being a huge orthinology fan means that I obviously love dinosaurs - and having recently learned about crazy species about such as the Basilosaurus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilosaurus), I realize now that great beasts once roamed this earth, far more amazing than anything my imagination could ever have come up with.

A few years ago I had played the open-world survival game Subnautica, a fantastical mastercrafted game about survival on an ocean planet roughly based on planet Gliese1214b, and was frankly so immersed by vastness of the ocean and creatures in it, that I always was disappointed that earth at least, was never populated by whimsical creatures like dragons, leviathans, etc. Except, I was horribly wrong.

Learning about life has been a bittersweet journey. When I learn about the frankly leviathan and biblical like creatures that roamed our planet like basilosaurus, I'm reminded that life is an indescriable unique thing, that is impossible to properly get a grasp on. One thing of fascination to me was the Great dying, an extinction event about 250 million years ago in which 95% of life on earth was wiped out.

Can you imagine that? All of earth's oceans, forests, jungles, etc empty. Imagine just walking through the landscape and seeing nothing but the occasional scavenging rodent, and odd bird here and there. The imagine brings a romantic, yet tragic feeling with it.
But more so what blows me away is that where we are now, all of the life on earth now is but 5% of what could've been.

A great sadness fills me knowing that fact, that this - what is now, is only a small percentile of what might've been possible. I can only imagine what the world might've looked like, had life not been beaten the way it was. And this is where that bitter in the bittersweet feeling comes in.

Life, like a candle in the wind was nearly extinguished. Almost completely gone, but it persisted. It came back, and in that sense I learned of persistence. It saddens me to know that one day I won't be able to look outside at the blue sky, feel the cold, hear the birds chirp or learn of the biblical monsters that roamed our planet; but until then I am reminded of how strange and delicate life is.

In the if I'm lucky 90 years I will live in total, I am nothing but a speck in comparison to the billions of years that have passed, and that will pass. I wonder then what god makes of all of this.
